codestar
========

Website to host a software tutoring service provided by [Jason Tanner]() and [Lucas Ou-Yang](http://codelucas.com). We will try to implement live video and secure payments into the webapp.

To deploy and begin to contribute, please first ensure that you have pip installed.

`sudo easy_install pip`

Afterwards, please install the dependencies of this project with

`sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`

Please indent code with `4 spaces`, no tabs!

For your own sake, use `virtualenv`, which is installed in the requirements.

This project as of now is running on [bootstrap3](http://getbootstrap.com/) for the front end, flask for our backend framework, and we are using [jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/) for our templating engine. We also intend on using [dwolla](https://www.dwolla.com/) for payments and [tokbox](http://tokbox.com/) (maybe) for video.
